A 2D pixel-style tower defense game developed using **Unity** and **C#**, where players must tactically deploy defense towers to prevent waves of monsters from breaching the castle gate.

## 🕹️ Gameplay Overview

In *Tower Defense 2D*, the player acts as the commander of a magical kingdom's defense force. Using gold and diamonds earned during battles, players construct and upgrade three types of towers:

- **Archer Tower**: Long-range, fast attack speed.
- **Mage Tower**: Deals area damage or status effects.
- **Barracks**: Summons knights to block and fight enemies.

Defend the base through **waves of enemies**, each increasing in difficulty and culminating in boss fights like *Frost*, *Minotaur*, or *Cthulhu*. Victory is earned by surviving all waves with your castle intact.
